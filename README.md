# Game of Life

A graphical implementation of Conway's Game of Life, coded in C for an undergraduate programming course in 2008.

As you can see, I was thoroughly unaware of the existence, or desirability at any rate, of such exotic beasts as "comments" when I programmed this. And #define. And for loops. And treating 0 or 1 as boolean in C. And I was iffy on subfunctions.

Also, although I have tracked it down, I have not yet explored the custom header FPT.h (or its associated functions), which was created by the course's professor, in order to recreate the graphics functions called so often here. So, the program cannot run as-is. I may start from scratch with the libraries available on Penn's system.

The text file is my original code, untouched since April 2008. The .c file is minimally cleaned up (mostly rearranging spaces, indentations, and line breaks to make the code more readable and consistent in style).
